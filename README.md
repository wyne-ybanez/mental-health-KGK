## Project Goal

COVID-19 has brought a lot of unease and anxiety to people who may have never encountered these feelings before, the on-going feeling of the unknown can overwhelm anyone. 

The background of our idea came from the HSE Covid-19 app where users track their physical symptoms, whether they feel good or aren’t feeling great, and the health services deliver advise on what course of action to take.  
Following the drastic rise in those affected by negative mental health symptoms, we wanted to expand on this concept. We are providing an app where the user can track their psychological symptoms, enabling communication with mental health services who can offer help and advice, called ‘Connected’. 


We hope to take advantage of the Technological savviness of the younger generation as a means of penetrating the market.  We believe it is still a Public Need which is not being fulfilled to the full effect by either private/public enterprise.
The data collected regarding user’s symptoms can be utilized by our team. With the adoption of machine learning algorithms and psychological analysis, we aim to provide highly personalized and catered solutions to our users. 

## Market Research 

### Market Drivers and Trends: 

Economic and health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have been asymmetric across all age groups especially youths and elderly and the Pandemic has created evident trends in mental health issues across the globe. Coronavirus has had huge implications on the Irish people’s livelihoods by ways of losing jobs, lack of social interaction and social distancing. Technology is how we aim to tackle this Lack of Communication

### Market Leaders: 

Humans are susceptible to countless illnesses, diseases, and injuries. As a group we are left aghast to the lack of attention given to our mental well-being. In a survey published by Mental Health Ireland in 2018, they reported that 93% of people felt that there was more we should be doing to improve or mental health and wellbeing. 
Our brains are sophisticated machines, filled with emotions, thoughts, and different layers of consciousness . Given our psychological modern-day understanding, it is of our opinion that now is the perfect time to apply this psychological understanding through useful and regulatory features of Connected.  

### Current market leaders and features:

- Headspace: Standard features include a timer, e-mail reminders, an app community, progress tracking, program training. Strengths: high-quality short video infographics, which compliment guided meditation tracks. Headspace has 10 million+ installs on the Google play store.
 
- Calm: Meditation, sleep aid, gentle movement and stretching, music designed to help focus, relax and sleep. Calm has10 million+ installs on the Google play store.
 
- Moodfit: Track and make daily goals to improve one’s mood, positive reinforcement messages, new habit help, mood tracker and journal, understanding relationship between lifestyle and mood. Mood has 10,000 installs on the Google play store. 
 
- Student Health App: offers plain talking reassurance, info + advice on over 125 topics. A strength of this app is its aim at university students however weaknesses could be its lack of features and home screen. Student health app has 10,000 installs on Google play store. 
 
- Chill Panda: Interactive game for kids, a panda avatar to explore world filled with positivity and coping techniques. This app is based on studies which show distraction as a key help for anxiety in kids. 

### Gaps in the Market 

There is currently a huge need in Ireland for health support for the public and not enough capacity for the growing demand. Coronavirus has only escalated the issues that many people have been struggling with and the public’s cry for help isn’t getting enough attention as the pandemic takes over national and global news feeds. 
Connected is focused on improving public health by advocating the importance of addressing mental health as outlined by the WHO

###  Description of the Idea  

- Our service will be delivered via app on mobile devices, tablets, and view web browser.  

- The key feature of this app is the inclusion of the user’s ability to track how they feel and access their log history. 

- Our ‘Big Red Button’ is an emergency feature that will be instantly available on the app or through the user’s device widgets screen and without the need for internet connection. 

- Access to a support group/community, links to other mental well-being apps, tips, and advice on how to best look after yourself, and a daily motivational quote are all part of the range of features included.
